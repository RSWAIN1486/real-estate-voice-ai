# Development Memory

## 2024-03-12 Initial Setup

### Challenges Faced

1. **Menu Data Integration**
   - Challenge: Needed to integrate menu items from JSON file with images in public folder
   - Solution: Created a utility function to handle image path generation and implemented proper error handling for missing images

2. **State Management**
   - Challenge: Managing cart state across components
   - Solution: Implemented Redux Toolkit with separate slices for menu, order, and theme management

3. **API Integration**
   - Challenge: Setting up proper CORS configuration between frontend and backend
   - Solution: Configured CORS middleware in FastAPI to allow requests from the Vite development server

4. **Responsive Design**
   - Challenge: Making the menu grid responsive across different screen sizes
   - Solution: Utilized Material-UI's Grid component with responsive breakpoints (xs, sm, md)

## 2024-03-13 Cart and Checkout Implementation

### Challenges Faced

1. **Managing state for cart items across different components**
   - Solution: Utilized Redux Toolkit to centralize state management, ensuring consistent updates and access across components

2. **Form validation for delivery details**
   - Solution: Implemented custom validation logic using React Hook Form, providing real-time feedback to users

3. **Ensuring responsive design for cart and checkout pages**
   - Solution: Used Material-UI's Grid and Box components to create a flexible layout that adapts to different screen sizes

## 2024-03-13 User Authentication Implementation

### Challenges Faced

1. **JWT Authentication with FastAPI**
   - Challenge: Setting up secure JWT-based authentication in FastAPI
   - Solution: Implemented OAuth2PasswordBearer with JWT tokens and proper password hashing using bcrypt

2. **MongoDB Integration**
   - Challenge: Connecting to MongoDB Atlas and handling user data
   - Solution: Used Motor for asynchronous MongoDB operations and implemented proper data models with Pydantic

3. **Token Management in Frontend**
   - Challenge: Securely storing and managing JWT tokens on the client side
   - Solution: Used localStorage for token storage and implemented axios interceptors to automatically include tokens in requests

4. **Form Validation**
   - Challenge: Implementing robust form validation for registration and login
   - Solution: Created custom validation logic with immediate feedback and error handling 

## 2024-04-25 Voice Agent Integration

### Challenges Faced

1. **Ultravox AI API Integration**
   - Challenge: Integrating the Ultravox AI API for voice-based ordering
   - Solution: Created a dedicated voiceAgentService and Redux slice to manage the voice agent state and API calls

2. **Voice Agent Component Design**
   - Challenge: Creating an intuitive and responsive dialog interface for the voice agent
   - Solution: Designed a chat-like interface with transcripts, mic/speaker controls, and visual feedback for the agent status

3. **Order Processing from Voice Agent**
   - Challenge: Implementing a way for the voice agent to add items to the cart and navigate to checkout
   - Solution: Created a client tool implementation that allows the Ultravox AI to add items to the cart and trigger checkout when the user completes their order

4. **Voice and Text Integration**
   - Challenge: Allowing users to interact with both voice and text inputs
   - Solution: Implemented dual input methods with a text field for typing and mic controls for voice interaction

5. **Responsive Design**
   - Challenge: Making the voice agent dialog work well across different device sizes
   - Solution: Used responsive styling with specific breakpoints for mobile devices to ensure a good user experience on all screens 

## 2024-04-26 Voice Agent CORS Issue Resolution

### Challenges Faced

1. **CORS Error with Ultravox API**
   - Challenge: Direct API calls from frontend to Ultravox API were blocked by CORS policy due to the `x-api-key` header
   - Solution: Created a backend proxy in FastAPI to handle calls to the Ultravox API on behalf of the frontend

2. **Backend Proxy Implementation**
   - Challenge: Needed to ensure secure and reliable communication between frontend, backend, and Ultravox API
   - Solution: Created dedicated voice_agent.py router file with endpoints to proxy all necessary Ultravox API calls

3. **API Key Security**
   - Challenge: Needed to protect the Ultravox API key from exposure in frontend code
   - Solution: Moved API key to backend-only code where it's not accessible to clients, enhancing security

4. **Error Handling**
   - Challenge: Proper error handling across multiple services (frontend, backend proxy, external API)
   - Solution: Implemented comprehensive error handling with appropriate logging at each level

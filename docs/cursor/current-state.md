# Current Project State

## Overview
This document tracks the current state of the Restaurant Voice Agent project, including completed tasks, in-progress work, and pending items.

## Completed Tasks

### Voice Agent Backend
- ✅ Set up Ultravox API integration in backend proxy
- ✅ Implement proper request/response handling for calls
- ✅ Fixed message format for initialMessages to match API requirements
- ✅ Added robust error handling and logging for API requests
- ✅ Optimized timeout settings and error recovery
- ✅ Added support for priorCallId to resume conversations
- ✅ Improved call termination to prevent background processing
- ✅ Fixed priorCallId implementation to use query parameters instead of request body

### Voice Agent Frontend
- ✅ Created VoiceAgent React component
- ✅ Implemented VoiceAgentSettings for voice customization
- ✅ Fixed voice selection to use user-defined settings
- ✅ Improved message format handling for previous conversations
- ✅ Added error recovery for microphone permission issues
- ✅ Created visual audio level indicator for user feedback
- ✅ Implemented multi-layered conversation persistence (memory, sessionStorage, localStorage)
- ✅ Added visual feedback when resuming conversations
- ✅ Fixed resource cleanup to prevent background voice agent issues
- ✅ Enhanced component lifecycle management for better resource handling
- ✅ Fixed invalid React hook usage in component cleanup functions
- ✅ Implemented proper Redux state access patterns for lifecycle methods
- ✅ Updated API calls to follow Ultravox specification for query parameters

### Optimization
- ✅ Improved image loading with proper caching
- ✅ Created reusable image loading utilities with error handling
- ✅ Implemented memory caching for image requests
- ✅ Added debug logging for failed image loads
- ✅ Refactored conversation resumption to use Ultravox's priorCallId
- ✅ Enhanced cleanup procedures for better resource management

### Voice agent initialization and settings management
- ✅ Message history support and proper formatting for Ultravox API
- ✅ Call creation and termination API integration 
- ✅ Enhanced dialog cleanup to ensure proper call termination in all closing scenarios
- ✅ Audio streaming and visualization
- ✅ Menu items loading and caching implementation

## In Progress Tasks
- 🔄 Performance optimization for menu loading
- 🔄 Further UX improvements for voice agent interaction
- 🔄 Testing conversation persistence across different scenarios
- 🔄 Order state management improvements
- 🔄 Restaurant selection experience enhancement
- 🔄 Voice agent performance optimization

## Pending Tasks
- ⏳ Add unit tests for voice agent components
- ⏳ Implement speech recognition fallback for browsers without proper support
- ⏳ Add analytics for voice agent usage
- ⏳ Create admin interface for voice agent monitoring
- ⏳ Implement offline mode support
- ⏳ Create user account integration for persistent conversations

## Known Issues
- Voice recognition may be unreliable in noisy environments
- Occasional delay in processing voice commands
- Image loading may still be slow on poor network connections
- Conversation persistence is limited to the same browser and device

## Next Steps
1. Complete performance optimization for menu loading
2. Create comprehensive test suite for voice agent functionality
3. Implement analytics integration
4. Address known issues with voice recognition reliability
5. Explore backend storage solutions for cross-device conversation persistence

## Next

- Implement advanced error handling for API failures
- Add unit tests for voice agent components
- Finalize e2e testing for the entire ordering flow

# Voice Agent Feature Design

## Overview
The Voice Agent is a conversational interface that allows users to order food from Dontminos Pizza restaurant using natural language voice or text interactions. It provides a seamless experience where customers can speak their orders, receive responses from a virtual agent, and checkout without needing to navigate the traditional menu UI.

## Core Features

### 1. Voice Conversations
- Natural language voice recognition for customer input
- Text-to-speech capabilities for agent responses
- Real-time audio level visualization for microphone activity
- Support for muting/unmuting microphone and speaker

### 2. Conversation History
- Maintains a transcript of the entire conversation
- Supports loading previous conversations
- Automatically saves conversation history for future reference
- Provides a visual distinction between user and agent messages

### 3. Order Processing
- Integrates with the existing order management system
- Recognizes food items, quantities, and special instructions
- Confirms orders with the customer
- Manages the checkout process

### 4. Voice Customization
- Allows selection of different voices for the agent
- Supports configuration of voice settings (temperature, model)
- Provides a settings interface for customization
